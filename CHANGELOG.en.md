## [1.16.0] - 2026-01-22

### 🚀 Node Management (Multi-Interface):

* **Node Renaming:** You can now change a server's name either through the web interface or directly using Telegram bot commands.
* **SSE (Real-time):** The web interface has fully transitioned to **Server-Sent Events** technology. Server statuses, charts, and logs now update instantly without delays.
* **Interactive Logs:** Real-time log streaming with smart auto-scroll and visual loading indicators (spinners).

### 📦 Backup & Traffic Module:

* **Traffic Data Protection:** Statistics are no longer lost during **server shutdowns** or **internet connection outages**. Data is saved automatically and restored as soon as the server is back online.
* **New Backup Module:** A dedicated module (`backups.py`) allows you to manage traffic backups (manual creation and deletion) directly through the bot.
* **Automatic Saving:** The system takes a "snapshot" of traffic data every 5 minutes.
* **Smart Reboot Recognition:** The bot automatically detects whether it was a simple script restart or a full server reboot (via `boot_time`), ensuring continuous and accurate traffic calculation.
* **State Synchronization:** Full real-time synchronization of backup states between the backend and the web interface.

### 🛡️ Security & Monitoring:

* **SSH Monitoring:** Added recognition of **SSH key** logins (in addition to password logins) with instant notifications to the administrator.
* **Config Encryption:** Sensitive data on disk is now protected with **Fernet encryption** (AES), and passwords use the modern **Argon2** algorithm.
* **Web Data Obfuscation:** IP addresses and session tokens are transmitted to the browser in an encrypted format to prevent interception.

### 👷 System & Deployment (deploy.sh):

* **Environment Isolation:** Python and Docker updates to the latest versions now occur strictly within the isolated bot environment (`venv`), keeping the host system clean.
* **Accelerated Updates:** Implemented SHA-256 hash checks—the script skips dependency and database migration steps if no changes are detected.

---

## [1.14.0] - 2026-01-02

## 🔄 New update system (Smart Update)

The update module (`modules/update.py `) has been completely rewritten.

* **Separation of updates:** Previously, the upgrade command just ran the `apt upgrade'. Now the bot offers a choice:
* **Update the bot:** Downloads fresh code from Git, updates dependencies (`pip`), and restarts the service (Systemd or Docker).
* **Update the system:** Performs the standard update of Linux packages ('apt update && apt upgrade`).

* **Self-Healing:** The bot has learned how to restart its process after updating. For Docker, a container restart mechanism is implemented via `docker restart` (using the container name from the environment variables).
* **Background check:** Added the `auto_update_checker` task, which checks for a new version on GitHub every 6 hours and sends a notification to the administrator with a Changelog.

### 🌐 Web Interface Improvements (WebUI)

Into the core of the web server (`core/server.py `) added a number of new APIs and functions:

* **Sessions Manager:**
* Added API `api_get_sessions' to view all active logins (IP, browser, login time).
* Implemented the possibility of **forced termination of sessions** (the "Log out on all devices" button or revocation of a specific session) via `api_revoke_session'.

* **Notification Center:**
* The web dashboard now has a notification bell (API `api_get_notifications`), which stores the history of important events (inputs, errors), and not only sends them to Telegram.

* **Web update:**
* A tab has been added to the WebUI settings to check and run bot updates directly from the browser (`api_check_update`, `api_run_update').

### 🛡️ Security

* **Password protection (Brute-Force Protection):**
* Implemented `check_rate_limit` in 'core/server.py `. If there are 5 unsuccessful login attempts from one IP, this IP is blocked for 5 minutes.

* **Restoring access (Magic Link):**
* If you forgot the password from the web panel, you can now request the **Magic Link** (temporary login link) via the Telegram bot and reset the password ('handle_reset_request`).

### 📜 Changes in `deploy.sh `:

* **Configuration caching:** Added the `load_cached_env` function, which automatically downloads settings (Token, Admin ID, Port) from an existing `.env` file or its backup (`/tmp/tgbot_env.bak`).
* **Simplify reinstallation:** The installation logic (`install_systemd_logic', `install_docker_logic`, `install_node_logic`) has been updated to use the downloaded data. Now the script skips the steps of entering tokens and settings, if they were entered earlier.
* **Intellectual issues:** The 'msg_question` function now checks for the value of a variable before requesting input. If the value is loaded from the cache, the question is not asked to the user.

---
## [1.13.2] - 2025-12-09

### 🚀 Low-End Server Optimization
*Refactored code for stable operation on servers with limited resources (specifically < 1GB RAM).*

* **Log Reader:** Rewrote the log reading mechanism in `core/server.py`. Instead of loading the entire file into memory, it now uses `collections.deque` to stream only the last 300 lines. This prevents RAM spikes (OOM Kills) with large log files.
* **Database (Nodes DB):** Optimized the node list query (`get_all_nodes`). The heavy metric `history` data is now loaded only when viewing a specific node details, rather than for the entire list at once.
* **Memory Cleanup:** Removed the obsolete `buttons_map` mechanism in `bot.py` and `keyboards.py`, which duplicated button objects in memory but was no longer used.
* **Server List Caching:** Optimized the loading of the large JSON server list in `speedtest.py` (switched to streamed processing).

### 🧹 Cleanup & Misc
* **Dependencies:** Removed the `Pillow` library from `requirements.txt`. QR code generation has been switched to native `qrcode` methods to reduce heavy dependencies.
* **Legacy Code:** Removed unused imports and "dead" code remaining from older menu versions.

---

## [1.13.0] - 2025-12-07

### 🚀 Added:

* **Categorized Menu (New UX):**
    * Complete redesign of the Telegram bot navigation. Instead of a long list of commands, a structured menu with 5 categories has been introduced: **📊 Monitoring**, **⚙️ Management**, **🛡️ Security**, **🛠️ Tools**, and **🔧 Settings**.
    * This makes the interface cleaner and simplifies access to functions.

* **Keyboard Builder:**
    * Implemented a **module visibility management system**. Administrators can now enable or disable the display of any buttons in the bot menu at their discretion.
    * Configuration is available in two ways:
        1.  **Via Web Panel:** New "Bot Keyboard" section in Settings with toggles and bulk actions.
        2.  **Via Bot:** Interactive configuration menu (Settings -> 🎛 Configure Buttons).

### ✨ Improved:

* **Web Interface (Settings):**
    * The settings page design has been updated to support the keyboard configurator. Added save animations and loading states.
* **Bot Navigation:**
    * Improved logic for "Back" buttons: they now return the user to the corresponding subcategory instead of the main menu.
---

## [1.12.4] - 2025-12-06

### 🚑 Hotfixes:

* **Docker Compatibility (ProcFS):**
    * Fixed `500 Internal Server Error` and `OCI runtime create failed` on newer Docker/Linux kernel versions caused by restricted mounting over the `/proc` system directory (masked paths).
    * Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use safe mount paths: host metrics are now mounted to `/proc_host` (e.g., `/proc/uptime` -> `/proc_host/uptime`).
    * Updated the bot core (`bot.py`) and utilities (`core/utils.py`) to read system data (CPU, RAM, Uptime) from the new `/proc_host` directory when running inside a container.

### 🚀 Added:

* **Automatic HTTPS Configuration:**
    * Added an **SSL** setup wizard to the installation scripts (`deploy.sh` and `deploy_en.sh`).
    * You can now automatically deploy **Nginx** as a reverse proxy and obtain a free **Let's Encrypt** certificate (Certbot) for secure Web Panel access during installation.

### ✨ Improved:

* **Deployment Scripts:**
    * Updated `docker-compose.yml` generation in `deploy.sh` to implement safe mount paths.
    * Added `psmisc` utility installation (provides `fuser`/`lsof` commands) for more reliable port usage checks before SSL setup.
* **Telegram Authorization Integration:**
	* The authorization page now has three authorization forms: HTTP (unsecured connection) - authorization via Magic Link, HTTPS - the official Telegram authorization widget, and http/https - authorization via ID and password**.
---

## [1.12.3] - 2025-11-25

### ✨ Web Interface Improvements (UX):

* **Hints System:**
    * Added interactive icons with tooltips for all input fields on the **Settings** page (CPU/RAM/Disk Thresholds, Traffic Intervals, and Timeouts).
    * Added pop-up tooltips on the **Dashboard** when clicking on resource and traffic metrics, explaining the indicators.
* **Enhanced Validation:**
    * Added dynamic name validation (minimum 2 characters) in the Node creation form (`settings.js`) with visual blocking of the create button.
* **Interface:** Added new loading and transition animations on the login and settings pages.

### 🪵 Logging and File System:

* **Node Log Isolation:** Added a separate directory `logs/node/` for storing client-side (agent) logs.
* **Extended Log Clearing:**
    * The API (`core/server.py`) now supports granular log clearing. You can clear bot logs, watchdog logs, or node logs separately (supported via the `type` parameter in the request).
    * Updated the log clearing button in the Web-UI with improved process indication.

### 🛡️ Security:

* **Rate Limiter (Web-Login):**
    * Implemented protection against Brute-Force attacks on the login form in `core/server.py`. The IP address is blocked for 5 minutes after 5 failed password attempts.
* **System Modals:** Implemented a new system of secure modal windows (`showModalConfirm`, `showModalPrompt`) in `common.js` for confirming critical actions, replacing standard browser `alert/confirm`.

### 🔧 Fixes and Optimization:

* **Settings Validation:** Added checks for minimum and maximum values for traffic update intervals (5-100 sec) and node timeout.
* **i18n:** Added missing translation keys for new tooltips and log clearing confirmation modals.

---
## [1.12.2] - 2025-11-23

### ✨ Core & UX Improvements:

* **Web Interface (UX):** Added comprehensive, stylized tooltips (hints) to all input fields (Thresholds, Intervals) on the Settings page and all resource metrics (CPU, RAM, Traffic) on the Dashboard for enhanced usability.
* **Speedtest Prioritization:** Implemented advanced server selection logic to prioritize geographical proximity over raw ping: **Continent** > **Country** > **Domain Name** > **Minimum Ping**. This significantly improves regional test accuracy.
* **Speedtest Stability:** Hardened iperf3 test logic to be more resilient against common errors ("server is busy," "connection refused," JSON parsing failures). This improves the success rate of test attempts.

### 🖥 Node Agent (Client)

* **Full Speedtest Implementation:** The Node Agent (`node/node.py`) now executes and fully parses results from dual **iperf3** tests (Download/Upload) instead of using a placeholder ping.
* **Traffic Monitoring:** Fixed live traffic display (`btn_traffic`) to correctly calculate and report instantaneous network **speed (Mbit/s)** alongside total traffic volume (GB/TB).
* **Enhanced Selftest (`btn_selftest`):** Improved the node information report to include:
    * Formatted Uptime, Kernel/OS version, and external IP.
    * Reliable Internet Connectivity check using an **HTTP HEAD request** (`curl -I`) instead of relying solely on ICMP ping.
* **Uptime Display Fix:** Corrected the display of Node Uptime in the Telegram management menu to show the properly formatted `Xd Yh Zm` string (instead of raw seconds).

### 🔧 Fixes:

* **SSH Log Date:** Fixed a regression in the `selftest` module where the date and time were missing from the "Last SSH Login" entry.

---

## [1.12.1] - 2025-11-23

### 🚑 Hotfixes:

* **Node Agent (`node/node.py`):**
    * Fixed a critical bug where the agent file was overwritten with server module code. This caused a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiogram'` error when starting on remote nodes.
    * Restored the correct lightweight agent code using only `requests` and `psutil`.

* **Variable Name Conflict (i18n):**
    * Resolved `TypeError: 'bytes' object is not callable` and `UnboundLocalError` errors.
    * In modules `selftest`, `fail2ban`, `sshlog`, and `xray`, the `_` variable (translation function) was accidentally overwritten by the `stderr` output of system commands. Variables have been renamed, and conflicts resolved.

* **Freeze on Restart (Watchdog/Systemd):**
    * Fixed an issue where the `tg-bot` service did not stop correctly and was killed by the system due to timeout (`SIGKILL`).
    * Added forced termination of the process group (`tail -f`) in the `notifications.py` module when stopping the bot.
    * Added proper handling of `asyncio.CancelledError` in `core/server.py` (Web Agent), allowing background tasks to terminate gracefully.

### 🔧 Misc:

* Added missing imports (`requests`, `signal`) in `core/server.py` and `modules/notifications.py`.
* Improved stability of background monitors.
---

## [1.12.0] - 2025-11-23

### ⚡️ Architecture & Performance:

* **SQLite Migration:**
    * Completely abandoned JSON files (`nodes.json`) for data storage. Implemented **SQLite** database (via `aiosqlite`) for reliable storage of nodes, tasks, and metric history.
    * Implemented **seamless migration**: upon the first launch, the bot will automatically transfer all existing nodes from JSON to the database.
* **Async Core (AsyncIO):**
    * Fully replaced the blocking `requests` library with asynchronous `aiohttp` throughout the project (`core/utils.py`, `speedtest`, `server`).
    * Network delays (e.g., when fetching country flags or IPs) no longer block the bot and interface operations.

### 🛡️ Security:

* **Shell Injection Protection:**
    * Implemented mandatory command argument escaping using `shlex.quote()` in `xray`, `speedtest`, and `nodes` modules. This eliminates the risk of arbitrary command execution via manipulation of container names or addresses.

### 🔧 Fixed & Updated:

* **Dependencies:** Added `aiosqlite` and `aiohttp` to `requirements.txt`.
* **Speedtest:** The module has been rewritten to use `aiohttp` and secure subprocess calls.
* **Web Server:** Updated application initialization to work with the asynchronous DB.
---

## [1.11.1] - 2025-11-22

### 🛡️ Security:

* **Session Vulnerability Fix:**
    * Completely removed user data storage in cookies. Implemented **server-side sessions** using cryptographically secure random tokens.
    * Set `HttpOnly=True` and `SameSite=Lax` flags for the session cookie to protect against interception (XSS) and request forgery (CSRF).
* **XSS Protection (Web-UI):**
    * Implemented mandatory HTML character escaping in the dashboard (`dashboard.js`) for node names, IP addresses, and tokens to prevent malicious JS code execution.
* **Brute-Force Protection:**
    * Added a **Rate Limiter** for the Web Panel login form. Limit: 5 failed attempts per 5 minutes from a single IP.
* **CI/CD Fixes (Bandit):**
    * Resolved security errors `B602` (subprocess with shell=True) in `node`, `xray`, and `optimize` modules by explicitly marking safe calls.

### 🔧 Fixed:

* Restored the GitHub Actions (Security Scan) pipeline, which was previously blocked due to Bandit false positives.
---

## [1.11.1] - 2025-11-22

### 🚀 Added:

* **Node Management (Multi-server):** Implemented "Agent-Server" architecture. The main bot can now manage multiple remote servers (nodes) via a single interface.
    * New module **"🖥 Nodes"** (`btn_nodes`) to view the list of connected servers, their status, and execute commands.
    * Remote command support: `Traffic`, `Top`, `Speedtest`, `Uptime`, `Reboot`.
* **Agent (`tg-node`):** Lightweight client script (`node/node.py`) for installation on subordinate servers. Runs as a systemd service and sends statistics to the main bot.
* **Built-in Web Server:** Integrated an asynchronous `aiohttp` server (port 8080) into the bot core to receive heartbeats from nodes and serve the Web-UI.
* **Web Interface:** Accessing the bot's IP in a browser now displays a stylish HTML Status Page showing agent status and the active node count.
* **`deploy.sh` Update:** Added menu option **"8) Install NODE (Client)"** for quick setup of remote servers with automatic service generation.

### ✨ Improved:

* **API Stability (Throttling):** Implemented a "smart" message editing throttling mechanism in `traffic` and `speedtest` modules. This prevents `TelegramRetryAfter` (Flood Wait) errors during frequent status updates.
* **Notification System:** Added a new alert type — **"Node Downtime"**. The bot will notify the admin if a remote server stops sending heartbeats (20-second timeout) and when connectivity is restored.
* **Database:** Added `core/nodes_db.py` module for storing node configuration and state in JSON format.

### 🔧 Fixed:

* **Dependencies:** Added `aiohttp` library to `requirements.txt`, required for the API server.
* **Logging:** Optimized log structure for Node client mode.

---
## [1.10.14] - 2025-11-03

### 🚀 Added:

* **Full Docker Support:** Added the ability to install and run the bot in Docker containers (`root` and `secure` modes).
* **Docker Deployment Scripts:** `deploy.sh` and `deploy_en.sh` have been completely refactored to support selection between `Systemd (Classic)` and `Docker (Isolated)` installations.
* **Docker Dependency:** The `docker` Python library has been added to `requirements.txt` for the watchdog to interact with the Docker API.
* **Docker Configuration:** New environment variables (`DEPLOY_MODE`, `TG_BOT_NAME`, `TG_BOT_CONTAINER_NAME`) added to `.env.example` for Docker deployment.
* **`get_host_path` Utility:** Added a function to `core/utils.py` to correctly resolve paths to host system files (e.g., `/proc/`, `/var/log/`) when running in `docker-root` mode.

### ✨ Improved:

* **Watchdog (`watchdog.py`):** Completely rewritten to support `DEPLOY_MODE`. It can now monitor the status of both `systemd` services and Docker containers using the Docker SDK.
* **Module Docker Compatibility:** Modules `selftest`, `uptime`, `fail2ban`, `logs`, `notifications`, and `sshlog` updated to use `get_host_path()` for host file access, ensuring functionality in `docker-root` mode.
* **Server Management from Docker:**
    * The `reboot.py` module now correctly executes a host reboot (`chroot /host /sbin/reboot`) from `docker-root` mode.
    * The `restart.py` module now executes `docker restart <container_name>` if the bot is running in Docker.
* **Docker Install Reliability:** Applied a `cgroups` fix (creating `daemon.json`) in `deploy.sh` for stable Docker startup on modern OSes (e.g., Debian 12) and improved `docker-compose` installation logic.
* **Deployment Scripts (`deploy.sh`, `deploy_en.sh`):** Functions `update_bot`, `uninstall_bot`, and `check_integrity` now correctly detect and manage both Systemd and Docker installations.

### 🔧 Fixed:

* **Authentication (`core/auth.py`):** Fixed a critical bug in `load_users` and `is_allowed` where admin rights were checked using the localized string ("Админы") from the `main` branch instead of the "admins" key.
* **Permissions (`core/auth.py`):** Clarified the logic for `root_only_commands` to always require administrator privileges (`is_admin_group`) in addition to `INSTALL_MODE="root"`.
* **Security (`modules/logs.py`):** Fixed an XSS (HTML-injection) vulnerability in the "Recent Events" module by adding `escape_html` to the `journalctl` output (escaping was missing in `main`).

---

## [1.10.13] - 2025-10-26

### ✨ Improved:

* **Speedtest Localization:**
    * Results now display the country flag and city (instead of `Location`).
    * The `Server` field has been renamed to `Provider` for clarity.
* **Speedtest Server Lists:**
    * When the VPS geolocation is determined as Russia (`RU`), the bot will now attempt to use a list of Russian iperf3 servers from [GitHub](https://github.com/itdoginfo/russian-iperf3-servers) (in YAML format).
    * Added YAML file parsing for the Russian server list.
    * Added error handling for YAML list download/parsing with a fallback to the main JSON list.
    * The `deploy.sh`/`deploy_en.sh` scripts now install the `python3-yaml` system dependency.
* **Spam Protection:** Added a middleware handler (`core/middlewares.py`) that prevents overly frequent button presses (5-second cooldown).
* **Error Handling:** Improved exception handling in the `get_country_flag` function (`core/utils.py`) for more accurate detection and logging of network/API errors.
* **Logging:** Enhanced logging of unexpected errors using `logging.exception` to automatically include stack traces.
* **i18n Structure:** Keys within the translation dictionaries (`core/i18n.py`) have been sorted alphabetically for easier navigation.

### 🔧 Fixed:

* **Dependencies:** `PyYAML` added to `requirements.txt`. `python3-yaml` added to `deploy.sh`/`deploy_en.sh`.
* **Formatting:** Minor fixes to formatting and imports.

### 📝 Documentation:

* **Adding a Module:** Added a section with instructions on how to create and integrate custom modules in `README.md` and `README.en.md`.
* Updated version and build numbers.

## [1.10.12] - 2025-10-22

### What's new?

#### 🚀 Added:

* **Multilingual Support (i18n):**
    * Added full support for **Russian and English languages** for all bot messages, buttons, menus, errors, and notifications.
    * Introduced a new `core/i18n.py` module to manage translations, including the `STRINGS` dictionary, functions for loading/saving settings (`load_user_settings`, `save_user_settings`), determining (`get_user_lang`) and setting (`set_user_lang`) user language, and the main translation function `get_text` (alias `_`).
    * Users can now select their language via the new "🇷🇺 Язык" / "🇬🇧 Language" button in the main menu, with settings saved in `config/user_settings.json`.
    * Added `I18nFilter` for Aiogram, allowing handlers to react to text commands regardless of language.
    * Added an inline keyboard for language selection (`get_language_keyboard`).
* **Documentation:** Added English versions `README.en.md` and `CHANGELOG.en.md` with switching links.
* **Deployment Script:** Added an English version of the deployment script `deploy_en.sh`.
* **Dependencies:** `iperf3` is now added as a dependency installed via `deploy.sh` / `deploy_en.sh`.

#### ✨ Improved:

* **Code Structure:** All user-facing strings have been externalized from module and core code into `core/i18n.py`.
* **`speedtest` Module:**
    * Completely rewritten to use `iperf3` instead of `speedtest-cli`.
    * Implemented finding the closest `iperf3` server by ping, prioritizing based on VPS country/continent.
    * Added message editing to display test status updates (locating, pinging, downloading, uploading).
    * Implemented multiple connection attempts to different servers in case of errors.
* **`traffic` Module:**
    * Added an inline "⏹ Stop" button to the traffic monitoring message.
    * Pressing the main button again no longer stops monitoring; the inline button must be used.
* **Watchdog (`watchdog.py`):**
    * All error and status messages now use the i18n system (in the default language).
    * Improved handling of network errors (`requests.exceptions.RequestException`) and JSON decoding errors when sending/editing Telegram messages.
    * Improved logic for detecting `inactive`/`failed` status from `systemctl` errors.
    * Added distinct statuses/messages for planned restarts of the bot and the watchdog itself.
* **Logging:**
    * Implemented daily log rotation for `bot.py` and `watchdog.py` logs.
    * Bot and watchdog logs are now saved in separate subdirectories (`logs/bot/`, `logs/watchdog/`).
* **`users` Module:** When deleting a user, their language and notification settings are now also removed.
* **`xray` Module:** Adjusted Xray update commands for Amnezia (added `wget`/`unzip` installation) and Marzban (added check for `.env` file existence).
* **Utilities (`core/utils.py`):** `format_traffic` and `format_uptime` functions now support i18n for units (B, KB, y, d, etc.).
* **Keyboards (`core/keyboards.py`):** All button texts are now translated into the user's language.

#### 🔧 Fixed:

* **i18n:**
    * Fixed handling of non-integer `user_id` when setting language.
    * Added error handling for string formatting and checks for translation key existence in `get_text`.
* **`users` Module:** Fixed the use of string keys (`admins`/`users`) instead of localized names in `callback_data` when changing groups.
* **Circular Imports:** Resolved potential circular import issues between `core/shared_state.py` and `core/i18n.py`.
* **Imports:** Corrected relative imports (`from . import ...`) within the core package for proper functionality.
* **`selftest` Module:** Moved the import of `_` inside the handler function to avoid potential i18n initialization issues.

## [1.10.11] - 2025-10-21

### What's new?

#### 🚀 Added:
* **"⚡️ Optimize" Button:** Added a new module (`optimize.py`) to execute a set of system cleanup and optimization commands (root admins only).
* **Log Check by Watchdog:** `watchdog.py` now checks `bot.log` for errors (`ERROR`/`CRITICAL`) after the bot service starts.
* **Update Notifications:**
    * `watchdog.py` now periodically checks GitHub Releases and notifies about new versions.
    * `bot.py` now checks for updates on startup and notifies the administrator.
* **Version Display in `deploy.sh`:** The installation/update script now shows the locally installed and latest available versions from GitHub.
* **Bot Name in Watchdog:** `watchdog.py` now uses the bot name from the `TG_BOT_NAME` variable (if set in `.env`) in its notifications.

#### ✨ Improved:
* **Watchdog Status Logic:** Improved tracking and display of bot service statuses ("Unavailable" 🔴 -> "Starting" 🟡 -> "Active" 🟢 / "Active with errors" 🟠).
* **Log Monitoring:** Reworked the `reliable_tail_log_monitor` function in `modules/notifications.py` for greater stability and elimination of `asyncio` errors.
* **`deploy.sh` Script:**
    * Improved detection of the target branch when run with an argument or via `bash <(wget ...)`.
    * Added clearer information about branches and versions in the menu.
* Minor changes in code formatting and message texts.

#### 🔧 Fixed:
* **`AssertionError: feed_data after feed_eof` Error:** Resolved an `asyncio` race condition error when reading logs (`tail -f`) in `modules/notifications.py`.
* **`NameError: name 're' is not defined` Error:** Added the missing `import re` in the `modules/optimize.py` module.
* **`unexpected EOF while looking for matching }'` Error:** Fixed bash syntax (missing parenthesis) in the `run_with_spinner` function in `deploy.sh`.
* **User Saving Error:** Corrected the user loading logic in `core/auth.py` so that added users are correctly saved to `users.json`.
* **New User Name Display:** New users are now immediately displayed with the name obtained from the Telegram API, rather than the temporary "New\_ID".

## [1.10.10] - 2025-10-20

### 💥 Breaking Changes

-   **Complete Modularization:** The bot's code (`bot.py`) has been completely reorganized. Logic is divided into the core (`core/`) and function modules (`modules/`). The old structure is no longer supported.
-   **Reworked `deploy.sh`:** The installation/update script (`deploy.sh`) now uses `git clone` / `git reset` for file management and includes an installation integrity check. The old installation method via `curl` has been removed. **A clean (re)installation using the new `deploy.sh` is required.**

### 🚀 Added

-   **Integrity Check in `deploy.sh`:** The `deploy.sh` script now automatically checks for the presence of all necessary files (`core/`, `modules/`, `.git`, `venv/`, `.env`, `systemd` services) before displaying the menu.
-   **"Smart" Routing in `deploy.sh`:** Depending on the integrity check result (OK, PARTIAL, NOT_FOUND), `deploy.sh` directs the user to the appropriate menu (Installation, Management, or Error Message/Reinstallation suggestion).
-   **Automatic `.gitignore` Creation:** The `deploy.sh` script now creates a `.gitignore` file to protect user files (`.env`, `config/`, `logs/`, `venv/`) from being overwritten during updates via `git`.

### ✨ Improved

-   **Project Structure:** The new modular architecture (`core/`, `modules/`) significantly improves code readability, simplifies maintenance, and makes adding new features easier.
-   **Installation/Update Reliability:** Using `git` in `deploy.sh` instead of `curl` ensures all current project files are obtained and simplifies the update process.
-   **Menu Button Grouping:** Buttons in the main `ReplyKeyboard` menu are now grouped into logical categories for better navigation (although submenus were removed in favor of a single menu).

### 🔧 Fixed

-   **User ID Error in "Back to Menu" Callback:** Fixed an issue where pressing the inline "Back to Menu" button used the bot's ID instead of the user's ID, resulting in access denial.
-   **`NameError: name 'KeyboardButton' is not defined` Error:** Resolved a missing import of `KeyboardButton` in `bot.py`.
-   **`systemd` Service Parsing Error:** Corrected incorrect formatting of the `[Service]` section in `.service` files created by `deploy.sh` (all directives were on one line).

</p>

## [1.10.9] - 2025-10-19

### 🔧 Fixed (Hotfixes)

-   **Freezing on Shutdown/Restart:** Completely resolved the issue where the bot would hang for 90 seconds (`SIGTERM timeout`) when stopping the service. Implemented correct signal handling (`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`) and shutdown sequence: stop polling, cancel background tasks (including `tail`) with timeouts, close session. Fixed `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` and `AttributeError` during session closure.
-   **False Alert System Trigger:** The Alert system (`watchdog.py`) now correctly ignores planned restarts initiated by the bot (checks `restart_flag.txt`).
-   **Duplicate Resource Alerts:** Resource checking has been completely removed from the Alert system (`watchdog.py`) and is now performed only by the bot (`bot.py`), respecting user settings.

### 🚀 Added

-   **Log Monitoring:** The bot now monitors SSH login events (`auth.log`/`secure`) and Fail2Ban bans (`fail2ban.log`) in the background using `tail -f`.
-   **Notification Settings:**
    -   Added a "🔔 Notifications" menu allowing users to enable/disable alerts for resources (CPU/RAM/Disk), SSH logins, and Fail2Ban bans.
    -   Settings are saved in `config/alerts_config.json`.
-   **Repeat Resource Alerts:** The resource monitor now sends repeat notifications if the load remains high for longer than the set cooldown period (`RESOURCE_ALERT_COOLDOWN`).
-   **Branch Selection in `deploy.sh`:** The installation/update script now allows selecting the GitHub branch (`main` or `develop`) before downloading files.
-   **Service Status Editing:** The Alert system (`watchdog.py`) now edits a single message to display status changes: Unavailable 🔴 -> Activating 🟡 -> Active 🟢.

### ✨ Improved

-   **Button Navigation:**
    -   The "🔙 Back to Menu" button now edits the message to "Returning to menu...", providing a smoother transition.
    -   "🔙 Back" buttons in submenus use `edit_text` to navigate one step back within the same message.
    -   Added a "❌ Cancel" button for VLESS link generation.
-   **Alert System (`watchdog.py`):**
    -   Renamed to "Alert System" with a 🚨 emoji in messages.
    -   Improved service status detection (`activating`) using `systemctl status`.
    -   Standardized status texts.
